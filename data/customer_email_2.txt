Subject: Confusing billing charges

Hello,

I noticed unexpected charges on our account for the last two months. The invoice line items list "Data Processing - Tier B" which we never selected. The billing page doesn't explain what Tier B entails and there's no clear way to downgrade to Tier A.

Can someone clarify what triggered the move to Tier B and reverse the charges if it was an error?

Regards,
Bob
