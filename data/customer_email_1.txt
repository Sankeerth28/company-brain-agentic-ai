Subject: Repeated crash when exporting reports

Hi team,

We've been experiencing a recurring crash whenever we export quarterly reports as CSV. It happens on rows with many embedded comments â€” the export fails with an "OutOfMemory" error and the application forces a restart. Our analytics team needs reliable exports for Friday reporting and this has blocked us twice this month.

Environment: Windows 10, app v2.14.3
Steps to reproduce:
1. Open report "Sales Q3"
2. Click Export -> CSV
3. Wait ~10-15 seconds, app crashes

Impact: We've missed two internal deadlines and analysts are doing manual workarounds.

Please advise on a fix or a temporary workaround.

Thanks,
Alice
